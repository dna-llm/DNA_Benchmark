Welcome to ðŸ§¬ BEND's documentation!
===================================

`BEND <https://github.com/frederikkemarin/BEND/>`_ is a **Ben**\ chmark collection for evaluating the performance of **D**\ NA language models (LMs).
The BEND codebase serves three purposes:

* Providing a **unified interface for computing embeddings** from pretrained DNA LMs.

* **Extracting sequences from reference genomes using coordinates** listed in bed files, and computing embeddings for these sequences for training and evaluating models.

* **Training lightweight supervised CNN models** that use **DNA LM embeddings** as input, and evaluating their performance on a variety of tasks.


The documentation covers the BEND codebase and includes instructions on how to extend it to new LMs and tasks. For a tutorial on how to run BEND on existing tasks, please refer to the 
`README file <https://github.com/frederikkemarin/BEND>`_ on GitHub.
